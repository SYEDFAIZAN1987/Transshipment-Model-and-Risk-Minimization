# 🚚 Transshipment Model and Risk Minimization

![Transshipment Model](https://github.com/SYEDFAIZAN1987/Transshipment-Model-and-Risk-Minimization/blob/main/pic%20main.jpg)

## 📘 About the Project

This project explores a **transshipment model** aimed at optimizing the distribution of goods among warehouses and minimizing associated risks. The focus is on balancing supply and demand across multiple warehouses while minimizing costs. Key techniques such as **linear programming** and **sensitivity analysis** are used to develop a robust decision-making framework.

## 📊 Key Results

- **Optimized Transshipment Plan**:
  - Reduced total shipping costs by 25% compared to initial estimates.
  - Balanced supply and demand effectively across all warehouses.
- **Risk Analysis**:
  - Identified cost-effective risk minimization strategies with detailed sensitivity analysis.
